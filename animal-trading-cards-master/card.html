			<p>Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely
				dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are
				themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas
				relating to the animal. The raccoon is noted for its intelligence, as
				studies show that it is able to remember the solution to tasks for
				at least three years. It is usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating
				about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates.</p>
